        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Francisco Ronquillo!</h1>
				<p> I like to learn alot about technology.
					Well I know a decent amount about technology now but I love to learn alot more soon.
					That's why I took this class in the first place.
					But next year i want to take the AP class so i could extend my knowlege on coding.
					But thats no the only thing that I want to learn about technology I want to learn almost everything about it.
					But you guys are probably wondering "Francisco why do you want to learn about coding and hardware specs of technology that kind of stuff seems boring".
					Well my reply to that is "Its not boring depending what person you are but this kind of stuff makes me happy because it's interesting for me".
					I think in 5th grade I started fixing stuff in the computer that my family didn't know how to fix.
					I felt good that I knew how to fix something that easy.
					ever since that I wanted to extend my knowlege on technology in general from coding to seeing hardware specs in stuff to building my own pc.
					So now Im in this class trying to code for preping myself to go to a good college to try to work at google.</p>
